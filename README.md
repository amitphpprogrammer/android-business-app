## Building

### With Gradle

The easiest way to build is to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) v1.+.
Once installed, then you can import the project into Android Studio:

1. Open `File`
2. Import Project
3. Select `build.gradle` under the project directory
4. Click `OK`

Then, Gradle will do everything for you.

You might find that your device doesn't let you install your build if you
already have the version from Google Play installed.  This is standard
Android security as it it won't let you directly replace an app that's been
signed with a different key.  Manually uninstall GitHub from your device and
you will then be able to install your own built version.
